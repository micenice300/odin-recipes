    <ol>

      <br />
      <br />
      <li>
        step 2 Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.

      <br />
      <li>
        step 3 Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with
        olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.
        Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.

      <br />
      <br />
      <li>
        step 4 Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour
        prior to using.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        step 5 Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550
        degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        step 6 Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour
        and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the
        size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.

      <li>
        <br />
        step 7 Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella <br />on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4
        teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon <br />pepper over the top. Randomly
        arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty
        areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.

      <li>
        step 8 With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release
        from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the
        preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on
        the stone.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        step 9 Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to
        6 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        step 10 Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then
        slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves
        randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
